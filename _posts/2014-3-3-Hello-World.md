title: Starting my adventures in rxAndroid Land
---

So.. A few months ago I started hearing a lot about this "new" hotness among Android developers called rxJava. Since it got really popupar among Android devs a library named rxAndroid was made by the community. 

This summer I decided to actually learn rxAndroid/rxJava and I couldn't find a better way to make an App to showcase the work done. I will be making a series of posts based on things that I learn while experimenting and dealing with common problems someone might find (since I tend to find ALL the problems, I believe that this posts will be very helpful and friendly). 

```java

public Observable<List<Object>> findObjects();

```
